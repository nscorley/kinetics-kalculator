# Component Specification: Kinetics Kalculator

## Software Components

### 1. Data Manager

**Description:**  
The Data Manager is responsible for handling the input and output of experimental data. It provides functionalities for loading data from various sources, validating the data against predefined rules, and managing data transformations required for analysis.

**Inputs:**
-  Experiment Mapping File
-  Machine Output File

**Outputs:**
-  Validated and structured dataframe ready for analysis
-  Error logs detailing any validation issues

**Functionalities:**
-  Load data from CSV or Excel files into dataframes.
-  Validate data types and ensure the uniqueness of (plate_number, well) combinations.
-  Check for filled and non-null values in critical columns such as time and value.
-  Automatically assign replicate numbers if not provided.

### 2. Analysis Engine

**Description:**  
The Analysis Engine performs all computational tasks required to transform raw data into meaningful kinetic parameters. It encapsulates the core analytical capabilities of the Kinetics Kalculator.

**Inputs:**
-  Dataframe from the Data Manager

**Outputs:**
-  Dataframe with additional columns for concentrations, reaction rates, and other calculated parameters

**Functionalities:**
-  Convert raw measurement values to concentrations using standard curves.
-  Filter data by specified time ranges.
-  Compute reaction rates through linear regression.
-  Remove background absorbance by fitting linear models to control samples.

### 3. Visualization Manager

**Description:**  
The Visualization Manager is responsible for generating visual representations of the kinetic data. It provides users with insights through plots and graphs, aiding in the interpretation of results.

**Inputs:**
-  Processed dataframe from the Analysis Engine

**Outputs:**
-  Graphical plots such as concentration vs. time, reaction rates, and Michaelis-Menten curves

**Functionalities:**
-  Generate line plots, scatter plots, and bar charts for different parameters.
-  Customize visualizations based on user preferences (e.g., color schemes, labels).
-  Export plots to various formats (e.g., PNG, PDF) for reporting and presentations.

## Interactions to Accomplish Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Convert Concentration Using a Standard Curve

1. **User** loads the experimental data into the system using the Data Manager.
   - **Data Manager** reads the Experiment Mapping File and Machine Output File, validates the data, and outputs a structured dataframe.

2. **User** initiates the conversion process.
   - **Analysis Engine** receives the validated dataframe, applies the standard curve to convert raw values to concentrations, and updates the dataframe with new concentration columns.

3. **User** reviews the converted data.
   - **Visualization Manager** can be used to plot the concentration data for visual inspection if needed.

## Preliminary Plan

1. **Develop Data Manager:**
   - Implement data loading and validation functions.
   - Create error logging for validation issues.

2. **Build Analysis Engine:**
   - Develop functions for concentration conversion, rate computation, and background removal.
   - Ensure integration with the Data Manager for seamless data flow.

3. **Design Visualization Manager:**
   - Implement basic plotting capabilities.
   - Integrate with the Analysis Engine to visualize processed data.

4. **Test and Validate:**
   - Conduct unit testing for each component.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure smooth interaction between components.

5. **User Interface Development:**
   - Create a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement.

6. **Documentation and Deployment:**
   - Write comprehensive user manuals and technical documentation.
   - Deploy the application in a lab environment for initial user testing and feedback.
